# Daily Planner

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to get more experience working with Javascript as well as local storage and Moment.js. Moment.js was used in this application to display the current date. It was also used to display certain block colors depending on the current time. Within this application you are able to enter in an event on any time block you wish and it will save into the local storage even if you leave the page and come back. The applicaiton also color codes the time blocks depending on the day so you can keep track of the past, present and future events. The practical aspect is to be able to track any daily meetings/events/to-do's a user might need throughout their work day and have it save until they would like to add something different.
